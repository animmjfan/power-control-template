# Pre-Beta 0.0.0.0.2

**NOT FUNCTIONAL** In this Pre-Beta the python code for ofd has been finished but I've been unable to test because of problems with my hardware but I am 99.99% sure this code will work on anything that can use a built-in bash terminal and python installed unless I made an error in my python code.

New Requirements:

1. An Apple device that can enter Recovery mode via computer (Doesn't need to be jailbroken can be a Stable device)
2. A adapter from your iDevice's port to usb or a dock
3. (optional) A usb to dock (if you want to have more ports)
4. A few iDevice tools (libimobiledevice and libirecovery [it might take a bit to install those on a chromebook as chromebrew isn't the best package manager])
5. git
6. and a basic idea of ssh and how to set a ssh local server on your chromebook/laptop (Note. this can be a privacy risk use at your own risk)
If you have some knowledge you can modify the code to run only on the raspi or only on the computer with a bit of tweaking

UPDATE: This project no longer requires anything mentioned all you need to do is make some files and make any way you want that lets you achieve the power control, the script calls on.sh and off.sh and from memory checks if a file exists or maybe reads it so as long as when you want it turn on you have something do that, it will work. sorry for this
